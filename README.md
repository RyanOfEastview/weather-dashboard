# weather-dashboard

A basic weather dashboard that will present you with the weather conditions along with UV index for the next five days along with the currenty day's forecast.

When a city is searched for, the results will be stored in local storage and will be displayed as resuseable buttons on the left of the screen.

The weather conditions include icons depicting the forecasted weather.

The UV index will indicate a colour of severity depening on the UV levels for that city.
